Data Acquisition and Control of a Model Rocket with an MCU based Flight Computer 

Tristan Hill - 2021 - 2025                             

## Overview
This project contains MCU programs and other utilities related to data acquisition and control of a model rocket. The rocket payload contains an on-board flight computer consisting of a micro-controller and sensor package for collecting flight data and environmental conditions during the launch of a model rocket. 

## Astract (GSET 2025)
Space travel is an exciting and important cross discipline engineering application essential for communication, defense, and exploration. Rockets are primarily used for deploying vehicles from earth, and the prediction and measurement of a rocket apogee, or maximum distance from earth, is critical for mission success. Participants will engage in an exciting engineering project including the design, fabrication, and launch of a custom model rocket with an on-board sensor suite and data acquisition payload for monitoring flight performance. The primary goals of the project are designing a rocket capable of successful launch with recovery and predicting and measuring the rocket apogee during flight. Engineering activities include 3D computer aided design (CAD), additive manufacturing and 3D printing, analytical and numerical analysis, computer programming with embedded systems, and empirical testing. Students will be exposed to and learn the basics of Solidworks for CAD, FDM 3D printing, Arduino MCUs and C++ programming, and rocket modeling and analysis.
  
## Mission Information

Note: This is the master README that covers all hardware and missions. The missions are MCU and rocket specific so choose the branch appropriate to the MCU in use for specific code and mission data.
