    - [x] basic drawing
    - [x] sketch constraints  
      - [x] coincident 
      - [] orthonogal
      - [] parallel 
      - [] colinear
  - [] 3D Features  
    - [x] Extrude 
    - [] Revolve 
    - [] Extrude Cut
    - [] Hole
  - [x] Saving a Part
    - [x] save as Solidworks part file .sldprt (DSS proprietary)
    - [x] save as stereolithography file .stl (standard - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)))
