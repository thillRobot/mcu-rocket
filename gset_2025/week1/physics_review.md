## Position, Velocity, and Acceleration

  Consider a single particle moving along a path...

  Position: $$x$$, $$r$$, $$s$$
           position is a function of time $$t$$, so we write $$x(t)=fn(t)$$ 

  Velocity:
          velocity is the time rate of change of position, or the slope
          $$v(t)=\frac{\Delta position}{\Delta time}=\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}

          when considering very small changes, this becomes the derivative
          $$v(t)=\frac{dx\left(t\right)}{dt}=\dot{v}$$

          the dot is used to indicate a derivate with respect to time

  Acceleration:
