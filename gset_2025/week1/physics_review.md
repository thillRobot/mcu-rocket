## Position, Velocity, and Acceleration

### Position:
  Consider a single particle moving along a path...

  Position Variables (symbols): $$x$$, $$r$$, $$s$$          

  position is a function of time $$t$$, so we write $$x(t)=fn(t)$$ 

###  Velocity:
  
  velocity is the time rate of change of position, or the slope
  
  $$v(t)=\frac{\Delta position}{\Delta time}=\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}

  when considering very small changes, this becomes the derivative
  
  $$v(t)=\frac{dx\left(t\right)}{dt}=\dot{v}$$

  the dot is used to indicate a derivate with respect to time

### Acceleration: 
  
  similarly, acceleration is the time rate of change of velocity

  $$a(t)=\frac{\Delta velocity}{ \Delta time} \rightarrow a(t)=\frac{dv(t)}{dt}=\dot{v}$$
  
  we can also write...  


## Force and Moment

  Why is the particle moving? What made it move?

  A force: 
  
  - is a push or a pull

  - acts on an object

  - requires an agent

  - is a vector

  - can either be a contact force ...

  - ... or a long range force

  - acts along a line of action


  Now consider the rocket with forces on it. How do you expect the rocket to move? Does the rocket move in a straight line? If not, why?

  A moment is a force acting at a distance.


## Mass, Inertia, and Moment of Inertia

 What if the force stopped? Would the particle keep moving? If so, why?

 The mass quantifies the amount of stuff in the object, independent of the size or shape. 

 The mass moment of inertia, quantifies the mass and it spatial distribution.   


## Fundamental Laws

### Newton's Laws

  - Law of Gravity

  - Laws of Motion 

1) An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion at constant speed and in a straight line unless acted on by an unbalanced force.

2) The acceleration of an object depends on the mass of the object and the amount of force applied.

3) Whenever one object exerts a force on another object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite on the first


## System Response and Stability

 What does it mean to say a system is stable? or unstable? how about quasi-stable?

 Attempt to derive the stability criterion for rocket (in 2D).
