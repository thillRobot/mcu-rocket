## Hardware Details

### On-Board Sensors

#### BNO055 - i2c Sensor Board 
   
  This driver uses the Adafruit unified sensor library (Adafruit_Sensor),
  which provides a common 'type' for sensor data and some helper functions.
  
  To use this driver you will also need to download the Adafruit_Sensor
  library and include it in your libraries folder.
  
  You should also assign a unique ID to this sensor for use with
  the Adafruit Sensor API so that you can identify this particular
  sensor in any data logs, etc.  To assign a unique ID, simply
  provide an appropriate value in the constructor below (12345
  is used by default in this example).

#### Compile and Upload with `arduino-cli` for MKR1010wifi

  Check for a connected board.
```
  arduino-cli board list
````
  Compile the script.
```  
  arduino-cli compile --fqbn arduino:samd:mkrwifi1010 data_logger_mkr.ino 
```
  Upload the script to the board.
```
  arduino-cli upload -p /dev/ttyACM0 --fqbn arduino:samd:mkrwifi1010 data_logger_mkr.ino
```

#### Compile and Upload with `arduino-cli` for NANO328p

  Check for a connected board.
```
  arduino-cli board list
````
  Compile the script.
```  
  arduino-cli compile --fqbn arduino:avr:nano:cpu=atmega328 data_logger_nano.ino
```
  Upload the script to the board.
```
  arduino-cli upload -p /dev/ttyUSB0 --fqbn arduino:avr:nano:cpu=atmega328 data_logger_nano.ino
```

#### testing 

  Listen to the serial connection with minicom. `ACM0` refers to a custom config file made with minicom.
```  
  $ minicom ACM0      
```
  After running the script the data file (.txt) should be on the SD card. Remove the card and inpect with a PC. If the filename defined in the script is a new name, then a new file will be created. If the filename defined in the script matches a file on the SD card, then that file will be appended with a new set of data entries.

  mount the SD card
  ```
  sudo mount -t vfat /dev/sdc1 /media/fat32 -o rw,uid=1000,gid=1000
  
  ```
